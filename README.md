# customInt
Fun custom integer class project I threw together.  
Essentially wraps a `std::vector<bool>`. *(I was not aware that this is not an STL container at the time of creation)*  
Addition, subtraction and multiplication are currently the only arithmetic operations supported.  
*There is lots of space for improvement and my c++ is rough.*
